                    Hi! My name is Robert Moore. I grew up in Chapel Hill, NC, and I presently live in RTP/Durham, NC. 
            
                        During high school I had an education focusing more on classic latin and history. While in school I excelled in chemistry and math, and ended up going to NC State University in Raleigh studying chemical engineering. 
                        
                        My career as of yet has spanned through polymer manufacturing and polymer research, as well as specialty materials R/D and QA. I'm excited to learn software to have a more full and rounded education with the capability to interact with computers in a meaningful way. 
                        
                        In my free time I enjoy bodybuilding, reading, cooking, and language learning. My best languages after English are Russian and Hungarian. I also like watching Canes hockey and No-limit Texas Hold'em.
